Dead simple way to keep track whether your projects on your Jenkins CI server
build successfully or not.

************
Installation
************

* Open ``index.html``, change the URL in the Javascript snippet at the bottom to
  point at your Jenkins installation.
* Open ``index.html`` in a browser.

You may optionally serve this file from a real server.

Once I figure out how this stuff (=mootools) works, I'll write up some nice docs
etc ;-)

*************
Configuration
*************

* Open ``index.html``, change stuff in the initialization of ``JenkinsWall``
  and/or attach events to it.
